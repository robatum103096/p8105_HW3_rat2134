## Problem 1

``` r
#Load dataset
data("instacart")
```

The `instacart` dataset contains information on grocery purchases of
131209 unique online users. The dataset contains 1384617 products from a
particular order and 15 variables:

  - Order identifier (`order_id`, integer vector)
  - Product identifier (`product_id`, integer vector)
  - Order each product was added to cart (`add_to_cart_order`, integer
    vector)
  - Ordered previously by user (`reordered`, integer vector) \[1 = Yes,
    0 = No\]
  - Customer identifier (`user_id`, integer vector)
  - Evaluation set in which the observation is located (`eval_set`,
    character vector) \[all observations in this dataset are from the
    training set\]
  - Order sequence number (`order_number`, integer vector) \[1 = first
    order placed by user, n = n’th order placed by user\]
  - Day of the week the order was placed (`order_dow`, integer vector)
    \[0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday\]
  - Hour of the day the order was placed (`order_hour_of_day`, integer
    vector) \[0 = 12 - 12:59 am, 23 = 11 - 11:59 pm\]
  - Days since last order (`days_since_prior_order`, integer vector)
    \[If user only has one order recorded, `days_since_prior_order` =
    `NA`\]
  - Product name (`product_name`, character vector)
  - Aisle identifier (`aisle_id`, integer vector)
  - Department identifier (`department_id`, integer vector)
  - Aisle name (`aisle`, character vector)
  - Department name (`department`, character vector)

We can interpret each row of the `instacart` dataset. For instance,
consider the first row of the dataset. We can see that order \#4 of user
\#112108 was completed on a Wednesday (`order_dow` = 4) between 10 am
and 11 am (`order_hour_of_day` = 10). Item \#1 added to this user’s
order was Bulgarian Yogurt (`product_id` = \#49302), from the yogurt
aisle (aisle \#120) in the ‘dairy eggs’ department (`department_id` =
\#16). This order was completed 9 days after the user’s previous order
(order \#train). This user has ordered this product previously
(`reordered` = 1).

We can interpret each remaining row of the dataset in a similar way to
obtain further information regarding the purchases of users over time.

There are a total of 134 aisles. The top three aisles in which the most
items are ordered from are:

1.  Fresh vegetables
2.  Fresh fruits
3.  Packaged vegetables fruits

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#Top three aisles where most items are ordered from
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  .[1:3,] %>%
  rename("Aisle" = aisle,
         "Number of Items Ordered" = n) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Aisle                      | Number of Items Ordered |
| :------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| fresh vegetables           |                  150609 |
| fresh fruits               |                  150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits |                   78493 |

``` r
#Plot showing the number of items ordered from each aisle
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle, department) %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n), y = n, fill = department)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    labs(
      title = "Number of items ordered from each aisle, by department",
      x = "Aisle",
      y = "Number of Items Ordered",
      fill = "Department") +
    coord_flip()
```

Here, we can also see that the most items are ordered from the three
aisles listed above, and these aisles are part of the ‘produce’ and
‘dairy eggs’ departments.

``` r
#Table showing the three most popular items in the 'baking ingredients' aisle
BAKING_INGRED_three_most_popular_items = 
  instacart %>%
    filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>%
    select(c(aisle, product_name)) %>%
    count(aisle, product_name) %>%
    arrange(-n) %>%
    .[1:3,] %>%
    rename("Aisle" = aisle,
           "Product Name" = product_name,
           "Number Ordered" = n)

#Table showing the three most popular items in the 'dog food care' aisle

    select(c(aisle, product_name)) %>%
    count(aisle, product_name) %>%
    arrange(-n) %>%
    .[1:3,] %>%
    rename("Aisle" = aisle,
           "Product Name" = product_name,

Three_most_popular_items_in_aisles = 
  bind_rows(BAKING_INGRED_three_most_popular_items,
            DOG_FOOD_CARE_three_most_popular_items,
            PACKAGED_VEG_FRUITS_three_most_popular_items)

knitr::kable(Three_most_popular_items_in_aisles)
```

| Aisle                      | Product Name                                  | Number Ordered |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | -------------: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |            499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |            387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |            336 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |             30 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |             28 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |             26 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |           9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |           5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |           4966 |

We can see that the most ordered baking ingredients are light brown
sugar, pure baking soda, and cane sugar. Similarly, the top three most
ordered items in the ‘dog food care’ and ‘packaged vegetables fruits’
aisles are provided. We can also see here that packaged fruits and
vegetables are ordered by many more people than dog food and baking
ingredients.

``` r
#Table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  select(c(order_hour_of_day, order_dow, product_name)) %>%
  group_by(order_dow, product_name) %>%
  summarize(round(mean(order_hour_of_day), digits = 2)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = product_name,
              values_from = "round(mean(order_hour_of_day), digits = 2)") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(order_dow =
           recode(order_dow,
                  "0" = "Sunday", "1" = "Monday", "2" = "Tuesday", 
                  "3" = "Wednesday","4" = "Thursday", "5" = "Friday", 
                  "6" = "Saturday")) %>%
  rename("Day of Week" = order_dow) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Day of Week | Coffee Ice Cream | Pink Lady Apples |
| :---------- | ---------------: | ---------------: |
| Sunday      |            13.22 |            12.25 |
| Monday      |            15.00 |            11.68 |
| Tuesday     |            15.33 |            12.00 |
| Wednesday   |            15.40 |            13.94 |
| Thursday    |            15.17 |            11.91 |
| Friday      |            10.33 |            13.87 |
| Saturday    |            12.35 |            11.56 |

We can see that, on average, users order both Coffee Ice Cream and Pink
Lady Apples at the latest time of the day on Wednesdays between 3-4 pm
and 1-2 pm, respectively. In addition, on average, users order Coffee
Ice Cream and Pink Lady Apples at the earliest time of the day on
Fridays between 10-11 am and Saturdays between 11am-12 pm, respectively.
