## Problem 1

``` r
#Load dataset
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The `instacart` dataset contains information on grocery purchases of
131209 unique online users. The dataset contains 1384617 products from a
particular order and 15 variables:

  - Order identifier (`order_id`, integer vector)
  - Product identifier (`product_id`, integer vector)
  - Order each product was added to cart (`add_to_cart_order`, integer
    vector)
  - Ordered previously by user (`reordered`, integer vector) \[1 = Yes,
    0 = No\]
  - Customer identifier (`user_id`, integer vector)
  - Evaluation set in which the observation is located (`eval_set`,
    character vector) \[all observations in this dataset are from the
    training set\]
  - Order sequence number (`order_number`, integer vector) \[1 = first
    order placed by user, n = n’th order placed by user\]
  - Day of the week the order was placed (`order_dow`, integer vector)
    \[0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday\]
  - Hour of the day the order was placed (`order_hour_of_day`, integer
    vector) \[0 = 12 - 12:59 am, 23 = 11 - 11:59 pm\]
  - Days since last order (`days_since_prior_order`, integer vector)
    \[If user only has one order recorded, `days_since_prior_order` =
    `NA`\]
  - Product name (`product_name`, character vector)
  - Aisle identifier (`aisle_id`, integer vector)
  - Department identifier (`department_id`, integer vector)
  - Aisle name (`aisle`, character vector)
  - Department name (`department`, character vector)

We can interpret each row of the `instacart` dataset. For instance,
consider the first row of the dataset. We can see that order \#4 of user
\#112108 was completed on a Wednesday (`order_dow` = 4) between 10 am
and 11 am (`order_hour_of_day` = 10). Item \#1 added to this user’s
order was Bulgarian Yogurt (`product_id` = \#49302), from the yogurt
aisle (aisle \#120) in the ‘dairy eggs’ department (`department_id` =
\#16). This order was completed 9 days after the user’s previous order
(order \#train). This user has ordered this product previously
(`reordered` = 1).

We can interpret each remaining row of the dataset in a similar way to
obtain further information regarding the purchases of users over time.

There are a total of 134 aisles. The top three aisles in which the most
items are ordered from are:

1.  Fresh vegetables
2.  Fresh fruits
3.  Packaged vegetables fruits

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#Top three aisles where most items are ordered from
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  .[1:3,] %>%
  rename("Aisle" = aisle,
         "Number of Items Ordered" = n) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Aisle                      | Number of Items Ordered |
| :------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| fresh vegetables           |                  150609 |
| fresh fruits               |                  150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits |                   78493 |

``` r
#Plot showing the number of items ordered from each aisle
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle, department) %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n), y = n, fill = department)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    labs(
      title = "Number of items ordered from each aisle, by department",
      x = "Aisle",
      y = "Number of Items Ordered",
      fill = "Department") +
    coord_flip()
```

Here, we can also see that the most items are ordered from the aisles
listed above, and these aisles are part of the ‘produce’ and ‘dairy
eggs’ departments.

#Table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  select(c(order_hour_of_day, order_dow, product_name)) %>%
  group_by(order_dow, product_name) %>%
  summarize(round(mean(order_hour_of_day), digits = 2)) %>%

              values_from = 'round(mean(order_hour_of_day), digits = 2)') %>%

           recode(order_dow,
                  "0" = "Sunday", "1" = "Monday", "2" = "Tuesday", 
                  "3" = "Wednesday","4" = "Thursday", "5" = "Friday", 
                  "6" = "Saturday")) %>%
  rename("Day of Week" = order_dow) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Day of Week | Coffee Ice Cream | Pink Lady Apples |
| :---------- | ---------------: | ---------------: |
| Sunday      |            13.22 |            12.25 |
| Monday      |            15.00 |            11.68 |
| Tuesday     |            15.33 |            12.00 |
| Wednesday   |            15.40 |            13.94 |
| Thursday    |            15.17 |            11.91 |

| Saturday    |            12.35 |            11.56 |

We can see that, on average, users order both Coffee Ice Cream and Pink
Lady Apples at the latest time of the day on Wednesdays between 3-4 pm
and 1-2 pm, respectively. In addition, on average, users order Coffee
Ice Cream and Pink Lady Apples at the earliest time of the day on
Fridays between 10-11 am and Saturdays between 11am-12 pm, respectively.
